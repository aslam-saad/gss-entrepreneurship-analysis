## Research Analysis: Gender and Religion Differences in Entrepreneurship

### Introduction

This research study explores the relationship between gender, religion, and entrepreneurship using data from the General Social Survey (GSS). The GSS is a comprehensive survey that monitors societal change and investigates various aspects of American society. The aim of this analysis is to examine whether there are any differences in entrepreneurial tendencies between genders and across different religious groups.

### Data

The GSS collects data to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes of individuals. It also compares the United States to other societies, aiming to develop cross-national models of human society. The data used in this analysis includes variables such as gender, religion, employment status (self-employed or working for someone else), and year of survey.

### Research Questions

1. Are there significant differences in entrepreneurial tendencies between genders?
2. Do different religious groups exhibit variations in entrepreneurial tendencies?

### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Gender Differences

To investigate gender differences in entrepreneurship, we first analyze the proportion of self-employed individuals over the years for different genders. The analysis reveals a significant difference in the sample proportion of self-employed individuals between genders. The plot below depicts the trend:

#### Religion Differences

Next, we examine the proportion of self-employed individuals across different religious groups. The analysis shows a significant difference in the sample proportion of self-employed individuals among various religious groups. The plot below illustrates the findings:

### Inference

#### Gender Differences

To test the hypothesis of gender differences in entrepreneurial tendencies, we set up the following hypotheses:

- Null Hypothesis (H0): The difference in proportions of self-employed between genders is zero.
- Alternative Hypothesis (HA): Proportion of self-employed males is greater than proportion of self-employed females.

Conducting a t-test, we find a p-value less than 0.0001, leading us to reject the null hypothesis. This provides convincing evidence that the proportion of self-employed men is greater than the proportion of self-employed women in the United States.

#### Religion Differences

To examine the hypothesis of religion differences in entrepreneurial tendencies, we set up the following hypotheses:

- Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no difference in proportions of self-employed people with different religions, and any observed differences are due to chance.
- Alternative Hypothesis (HA): There is a difference in proportion of self-employed individuals between at least two religious groups.

Performing a Chi-Squared goodness-of-fit test, we obtain a p-value less than 0.0001, indicating that the null hypothesis can be rejected. Hence, there is convincing evidence that the proportion of self-employed individuals differs across various religious groups.

### Conclusion

The analysis reveals significant gender and religion differences in entrepreneurial tendencies. Men have a higher proportion of self-employment compared to women, while variations in self-employment proportions exist among different religious groups. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of entrepreneurship in the United States, emphasizing the importance of considering gender and religion factors in entrepreneurial research and policy-making.
